Project Goal: The project's main aim is to extract short and informative summaries as well as create engaging titles from NTRS PDFs (NASA Technical Reports Server).

AI Technology: Cutting-edge AI models like BART, Google PEGASUS, and GPT-3 are used for text processing, enabling the system to understand and summarize complex technical content effectively.

NTRS PDFs: The project focuses on NTRS PDFs, which often contain technical and scientific information. AI-driven text processing helps in summarizing this information and creating reader-friendly titles.

Simplification: The project simplifies the extraction and presentation of technical content, making it more accessible and understandable for a wider audience.

Innovation: By harnessing the power of AI, the project explores innovative ways to transform technical documents into digestible summaries and catchy titles, enhancing their usability and impact.
